          <h3>CONSULTATION & PET SELECTION</h3><br>
          <p>An adoption counselor will review your application with you to make certain you have carefully considered the cost and responsibilities of pet ownership and to help determine what type of pet would be suitable for your lifestyle. Remember, cats can live ten+ years. Rather than adopt one that may prove unsuitable, it is best to revisit us until a pet that is compatible with your lifestyle is found. If you selected a pet and your application has been approved, we can proceed with an adoption contract. If, for some reason, your application is not approved, adoption will be refused.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>ADOPTION CONTRACT</h3><br>
          <p>The contract you sign is a legal agreement. We ask that you take the time to read the contract before signing. It states the conditions you agree to provide your pet. If at any time in the future you can no longer keep the pet, you will return it to our shelter. Spaying or neutering is mandatory by Delaware law when a pet is adopted from a shelter or rescue group. Animals will be sterilized before completion of adoption.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>THE BEGINNING</h3><br>
          <p>When you adopt from us, we will provide you with helpful adoption literature as well as any additional assistance we can provide to make your adoption a success. We want your adoption experience to be a happy one. We recommends the following be considered to ensure a happy relationship with your pet.</p>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li><b>VETERINARY EXAMINATION:</b> Within the first 7 days after adoption, your new pet must be seen by your vet to ensure good health and to continue routine health care. Your adoption contract has all available medical history of your pet. Make sure you present your contract to your Vet at the time of examination. DO NOT give your pet any over­-the­-counter medications AT ALL without consulting your vet first. </li>
            <li><b>OBEDIENCE TRAINING</b> helps train you to train your dog (not necessary for cats). We highly recommend you seek training within the first few months after adoption, as it will strengthen the owner-pet ­bond. We do not recommend any training program where someone else is training your dog without your presence.</li>
            <li><b>PET IDENTIFICATION</b> ­Along with the microchip, we will keep a registration record on file with vital information on you and your pet, where we can reach you, and your vet's contact information for emergencies. Even if you think your pet will never get out, it is best to have your pet wear its ID and license tags. Always make sure the microchip company has current information for you, or if your pet is scanned at a vet facility or elsewhere, there will be no way to contact you.</li>
            <li><b>IN THE EVENT YOU CAN NO LONGER CARE FOR OR KEEP THE PET THAT YOU ADOPTED, YOU ARE REQUIRED TO BRING IT BACK TO OUR SHELTER.</b> If you feel you found a suitable home for the pet, the person interested in your pet must visit the shelter and sign an adoption agreement with us. This requirement protects your pet by ensuring the new owner will provide a responsible home. If you have been found to break this agreement, we will not adopt any more pets to you.</li>
